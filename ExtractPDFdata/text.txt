Special Processors
 
These are the processors which are designed for some special purposes. Few of the special 
processors are brief

 
Coprocessor
 
A coprocessor is a specially designed microprocessor, which can handle its particular 
function many times faster than the ordinary microprocessor.
 
For example
 

 
Some Intel math
-

 

 
8087
-
used with 
8086
 

 
80287
-
used with 80286
 

 
80387
-
used with 80386
 
Input/Output Processor
 
It is a specially designed microprocessor having a local memory of its own, which is used to 
control I/O devices with minimum CPU involvement.
 
For example
 

 

 
DMA (direct Memory Access) 
controller
 

 
Keyboard/mouse controller
 

 
Graphic display controller
 

 
SCSI port controller
 
Transputer (Transistor Computer)
 
A transputer is a specially designed microprocessor with its own local memory and having 
links to connect one transputer to another transp
uter for inter
-
processor communications. It 
was first designed in 1980 by Inmos and is targeted to the utilization of VLSI technology.
 
A transputer can be used as a single processor system or can be connected to external links, 
which reduces the constructi
on cost and increases the performance.
 
For example
 

-
bit T212, 32
-
bit T425, the floating point (T800, T805 & T9000) 
processors.
 
DSP (Digital Signal Processor)
 
This processor is specially designed to process the analog signals into a digital form. This i
s 
done by sampling the voltage level at regular time intervals and converting the voltage at that 
instant into a digital form. This process is performed by a circuit called an analogue to digital 
converter, A to D converter or ADC.
